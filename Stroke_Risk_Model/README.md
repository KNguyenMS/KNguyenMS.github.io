# Stroke Risk Prediction Model

This project explores and predicts the risk of stroke using data science techniques. It includes:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into the dataset to identify patterns and relationships.
- **Prediction Models**: Development and evaluation of machine learning models to predict stroke risk.

## Files
- `Stroke Risk Exploratory Data Analysis.Rmd`: R Markdown file for EDA.
- `Stroke Risk Prediction Models.Rmd`: R Markdown file for building and testing predictive models.

## Instructions
To view the analyses:
1. Open the `.Rmd` files in RStudio.
2. Knit the files to HTML or PDF for easier readability.

## Highlights
- **Data Cleaning**: Managed missing data and feature engineering.
- **Visualization**: Used `ggplot2` for data visualization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Evaluated logistic regression and KNN.

# Stroke Risk Model

This folder contains the code and data for the Stroke Risk Model project. 

## Contents
- `Stroke Risk Exploratory Data Analysis.Rmd`: R Markdown file for exploratory data analysis.
- `Stroke Risk Prediction Models.Rmd`: R Markdown file for stroke risk prediction.

## Required Files
The following data files are required to run the R Markdown code in this project. These are stroke datasets sourced from Kaggle used for the purpose of this project:
- `Stroke dataset 1.csv`
- `Stroke dataset 2.csv`
- `Stroke dataset 3.csv`

Ensure these files are in the same directory as the R Markdown files before running the code.

## Instructions
To reproduce this analysis:
1. Download the `.Rmd` and Excel files to your local system.
2. Open the `.Rmd` files in RStudio.
3. Install the required R packages (if not already installed).
4. Run the code chunks sequentially.

# ðŸ“š Book Analysis Project
This folder contains the code and data for my Book Analysis project. In this project, I analyze book trends using data from **Goodreads**, **Wikipedia**, and the **New York Times API**.

- **Objective:** Identify book rating trends and publication patterns.
- **Findings:** Fiction and Fantasy dominate; bestsellers maintain high ratings.
- **Methods:** Data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Contents
- `Project 2 Book Analysis.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook shows the entire process for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Required Files
The following data file was used to run the code in this project:
- `Books_v2.csv`

## Instructions
To reproduce this analysis:
1. Download the `Books_v2.csv` file and place it in the same directory as the notebook.
2. Open the `Project 2 Book Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

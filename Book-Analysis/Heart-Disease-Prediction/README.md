This project explores how logistic regression can be used to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on health-related risk factors.

- **Objective:** Identify key risk factors and assess prediction accuracy.
- **Findings:** Age, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, and diabetes were the strongest predictors.
- **Methods:** Data preprocessing, logistic regression, feature selection, and performance evaluation.
